# sm

A command-line interface for interacting with StepMania simfile packs - download new packs and update existing ones right from your terminal!

## Installation
`sm` is available as a downloadable binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/ScottBrenner/sm/releases).

## Usage
`sm` creates and interacts with an additional file within a pack's directory, `source.txt`. This file merely contains the source where the pack can be downloaded from.

First, navigate to a pack's directory and initialize `sm` with the `init` argument:
```
$ cd Games/ITGmania/Songs/
$ mkdir 7guys1pack
$ cd 7guys1pack
$ sm init
Enter download source for pack: https://zenius-i-vanisher.com/v5.2/download.php?type=ddrpack&categoryid=127
```
Please be aware that **the source URL here is the direct download location, and not the simfile overview page**. From the overview page on Zenius this URL can be found by right-clicking the "Download Pack" button and navigating to "Copy Link"

Once initialized, download the pack with the `download` argument, be patient as this may take some time:
```
$ sm download
Downloading pack...
Unpacking pack...
```

`sm` downloads the pack, extracts it, and deletes the downloaded archive. Already-downloaded packs can be updated with the same method.
